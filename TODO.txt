Add a way to salvage the parse tree upon failure. Maybe litter try ... finally every where,
making sure nodes are eventually added. Not sure how to "bubble up" the nodes tho, hmmm.
It may require a rewrite of the backend, maybe to use generators or something? Idk.
We could pass in a list that rules should attach generated nodes too, allowing the parse
tree to grow without the function having to return. However, we must be careful of Choice,
since failure is to be expected.
